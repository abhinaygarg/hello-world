# hello-world
My first code on github
Feeling very excited to get on this platform. Hopefully this will help me to understand the terms used by developers and thus help in increasing the productivity of the team.
To those who don't know me, I am Abhinay and I am currently working as a Project Manager in an IT firm, helping fortune 500 companies to get on digital transformation bandwagon so as to increase their market penetration and improve revenues.
